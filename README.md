# human-identifier-for-blink-cameras

My house is survellied by the use of Blink cameras. One problem I've had with them is the amount of "false positives" that are generated when a camera detects movement. The vast majority of the time, 
there is no human on the video feed. 

The purpose of this program is to take the clips generated by the Blink camera system, analyze whether a person is present in a particular clip, and send a push notification to my phone in the event that 
a person is present. 

**TODO**: Boot.dev README Requirements:
- What the project is, and what it does.
- How to clone and run it.

Looking into using the [blinkpy](https://github.com/fronzbot/blinkpy/tree/dev) library
